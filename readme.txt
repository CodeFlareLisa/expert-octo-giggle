# Project Description

We are creating a restaurant experience. This wonderful experience can be described as the following;
It is Friday night and you want to meet your friends at your favorite restaruant but are tired from
the week and do not feel like standing in line for a table and then having to wait to order your
food, and more wait time to get your food. 

Or maybe you want to meet your husband for that romatic dinner but do not feel like waiting for your 
table and then waiting for your food as well.

The thought of either scenario is exhausting! Now, imagine how life would be different if you could
go online, set your dinner reservation along with placing your food order! This way, you drive 
to the restaurant, are seated right away, and shortly after, your food arrives. 




This project includes making an online dinner reservation plus ordering your food ahead of time. 
This new experience is perfect for the couple/family/or friends that do not have a lot of 
time to stand and wait for the table and then sit and wait for the food. Our guests can also 
choose to make a table reservation without their food order, if they desire to do so.
